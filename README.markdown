# Facebook Group Analytics

## Introduction

### Why [was this project created?]
In the December 2011's meetup of [Nagpur PHP Users group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/nagpurpug/ "Nagpur PHP Users group on Facebook"), community members discussed about Facebook group administrators' need of giving something back to the community members. Group members give their precious time and expertise to community groups and administrators are not able to thank them enough for their contributions. Hence, this project.

### What [it does?]
We needed a simple Facebook application that anybody can use on localhost or on live server and built with code that could easily be reused in other projects.

### How [is it organized?]
On coding side, this project contains a PHP class that does most of the work like logging in to Facebook, getting permissions, getting list of groups, posting to group's wall, etc. in simple way, if you ask politely.

On simplicity side, this project contains examples that helps you log in, get permissions, get different statistics, edit data posting on group wall and finally post it to Facebook group's feed, everything on single page.

### Where [can I use it?]
We recommend you to install examples given in this project on [your local apache server](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=how+to+install+apache+server "how to install apache server") instead of live website. They behave almost similar whether on localhost or live server. And if you decide to put it on live server, make sure you have secured it's access.

### When [can I start using it?]
As soon as you add your Facebook application's appId and secret, you will be able to see examples working. You can create your own Facebook Application on [Facebook Developers](https://developers.facebook.com/apps "Facebook Developers") website.
